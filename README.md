# halfbakedstuff

Just gonna post daft ideas here, probably in python
Might do some website stuff too

random word: Stupid little program that gives you a random yet easy to say word.

Chat Bot: AI with a voice. Responds to what you say through the microphone. Usually just tells you you're a bad person and talks about hats and communism. Machine learning at it's finest. 

Speaking Random: A mash of the previous 2, it'll read out a stupid word. Kinda fun honestly.
